# INX-Employee-performance-

📌 Project Overview


INX Future Inc, a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider, has seen a decline in employee performance indexes, impacting service delivery and client satisfaction. This project aims to analyze employee data to identify key factors affecting performance and build a predictive model to assist in decision-making.


🔍 Analysis

📊 Data Exploration and Preprocessing

*The dataset includes attributes such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, overtime, and job role.

*Missing values and duplicates were handled during preprocessing.

*Categorical variables were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding (OHE).

*Feature selection was applied to retain only the most relevant variables for prediction.


🤖 Model Selection and Evaluation


*Algorithm Used: Gradient Boosting Classifier for its robustness and efficiency.

*Performance Metrics: Model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were evaluated.

*Feature Importance: Key predictors of employee performance were identified to provide actionable insights.



📌 Key Insights and Recommendations


*Work-life balance and EmpLastSalaryHikePercent were found to be significant performance factors.

*HR departments can leverage this model to enhance hiring, promotions, and employee support programs.

*Data-driven decision-making can optimize employee management and improve workplace conditions.
